# Virtual Reality
<!-- Want to build in an exquisite base, but the process is too cumbersome? Let this mod help you. -->
The purpose of mod basescanner is great. It allows players to share their designs of bases. This is an unqualified benefit for novices, since it is sometimes too cubersome for players to learn to design a nice base or an automatic factory. However, its function seems so complex that it is unstable. Thus I make this mod which has similar funcitons but is more stable and eaier to use.

## Virtual Structure
Adding a virtual thing tab where you can make virtual structures and virtual items without consumption.

Virtual structures and plants have no collision volume and actual usage, but they can be activated so that they are converted into real ones.

Use a hammer to destroy virtual structures, and dropping virtual items will make them disappear.  

## Record Your Base
VR Camera can record structures and plants in the area you specified.

VR Projector can project your record in form of virtual structures.

And this record can be found in `C:\Users\lenovo\Documents\Klei\DoNotStarveTogether\client_save\mod_config_data\VR_record`, so you can replace its content with another record. But please always remember back up your records, because VR camera will overwrite the record file once you use it.
